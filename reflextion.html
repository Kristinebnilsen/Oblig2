            <h1>Oblig 2: Option A - From wireframe to page</h1>


            <h2>From wireframe to actual pages</h2>
            <p>Wireframes are appropriate to use, as you will get a lot of information that you need to construct an associated website (to the wireframe), such as fonts, sizes, content position, etc. However, translating wireframes into an actual page could lead to complications.  
                Wireframes give a perspective on the website look. It is a sketch that will help you when you create the actual web page. By using a wireframe you will be able to create a website more easily, since you have already planned it. The most difficult part with this, is to get it as similar as what you had planned and wanted. Sometimes, it could be difficult to make the picture and text to be exactly where you want in the website, and therefore you may have to try and fail before you get the perfect final result. Another problem with a wireframe is that we can become so engrossed in ideas that we end up with a high-fidelity wireframe. This is not necessarily a bad thing, but it takes a lot of work to get it constructed and realized in HTML / CSS.  We also spent unnecessary time making different wireframes individually, which were not further realized. We also struggled a bit in the beginning due to a lack of precision. This led to a lot of coding that could have been prevented. It also made the project a little bit unclear, but this was consistently corrected.

            <h2>Implementing the page with regards to its responsive nature </h2>
            <p>Having a responsive design is all about making a website compatible with all types of screen sizes and devices. Implementing a page with regards to its responsive nature is not as easy as many would think. Responsive design is relatively cheap/easy to implement, but has typically longer load times on for instance mobile devices. On the other hand, it promotes simplicity/minimalism in design. The negative side with this type of design, is that the code is more complicated to scale the content (Interaction Design Foundation, w.d). Responsive design is important so every device can be used. For example showing data on small devices like a mobile phone. 

                There was a longer designing, developing and testing period. To make the responsive design work, it took a lot of extra testing time with trying and failing. In our case, we spent a lot of time figuring out how to customize the images, depending on the screen size. One of our struggles was that two of the pictures that we put on the website were not moved to the desired posititon. The same struggle happened with the headline/navigation bar and the captions on the website. Something more demanding than expected was to make the image responsive by using the picture element, and by putting the image and text next to each other. We went through what we coded, and made sure we had used uppercase and lowercase letters correctly. We also made sure we used special characters and spaces correctly. Several versions of the images were also created in different pixel sizes. The images scaled correctly in the end when we found the solution to our problem. This after a long time of pondering and frustration.

            <h2>"picture” vs “ img +srcset attribute”</h2>
            <p>Picture dictates what image the browser should use, compared to  img src which gives the browser a choice. The img src is more or less supported by almost all current browsers, which makes it easier for everyone to try out the webpage (Stack overflow, w.d). This is because the img src element is used to provide backward compatibility for browsers that do not support the element, and if none of the source tags match. In comparison, the picture element behaves like the video and audio element. Different sources are added, and the first one that will fit the preferences is the source that is going to be used. (GeeksforGeeks, 2021). Therefore, the img src element would fit this website the best. Additionally, the attribute also is easier to use in this case. By filling in alt=“text”, you are virtually finished.</p>
